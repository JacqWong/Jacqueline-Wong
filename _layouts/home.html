            <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl">I am an assistant professor in the Department of Education at the Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences of Utrecht University. My research focuses on enhancing self-regulated learning (SRL) through examining the effectiveness of instructional support, including the development of instructional materials. In addition, I employ innovative methods using trace data to measure and support SRL through learning analytics (LA). </p>

        <p class="text-xl">Before joining Utrecht University, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Delft Institute of Mathematics at the Delft University of Technology, focusing on educational research in the Program for Innovation in Mathematics Education (PRIME). I obtained my PhD (cum laude) and master's (cum laude) in Educational Psychology from Erasmus University Rotterdam. My PhD dissertation on Enhancing Self-Regulated Learning Through Instructional Supports and Learning Analytics in Online Higher Education was awarded the Best Thesis Award 2021 by the Erasmus Graduate School of Social and Behavioral Sciences. </p>

        <p class="text-xl">My passion for teaching and learning drives my interest in educational research. I have ten years of teaching experience across Singapore, China, and The Netherlands. Upon completing my teaching diploma in 2003 from the National Institute of Education in Singapore, I taught various subjects at public primary and secondary schools in Singapore. Apart from teaching, I was actively involved in piloting and implementing innovative Information Technology (IT) tools for education and was also involved in student welfare and development. In 2010, I took on a teaching position at the Singapore International School in Shanghai, China. In 2013, I became the coordinator of the optimal learning program, where I developed education plans to support different groups of students. Intrigued by students' learning process and how to enhance learning, I pursued my master's and PhD in educational psychology to equip myself with the knowledge to become a more effective teacher. I am particularly interested in designing instructions to support students who are struggling in their learning and to support students in using effective study strategies to optimize their learning. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-xl">In my current capacity as an assistant professor in educational sciences, I teach courses on educational psychology, education and ICT, and research methods and skills to students who are and might be taking on roles in the education sector. I enjoy discussing teaching and learning experiences and having students think of concrete examples in which educational theories can be applied. Furthermore, with the increasing use of technology in education, I would like to employ the use of learning analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance our understanding of the learning process and provide individual students with more targeted support.</p>
