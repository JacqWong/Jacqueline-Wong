            <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl">I am an assistant professor in the Department of Education at the Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences of Utrecht University. My research focuses on enhancing self-regulated learning (SRL) through examining the effectiveness of instructional support, including the development of instructional materials. In addition, I employ innovative methods using trace data to measure and support SRL through learning analytics (LA). </p>

        <p class="text-xl">Before joining Utrecht University, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Delft Institute of Mathematics at the Delft University of Technology, focusing on educational research in the Program for Innovation in Mathematics Education (PRIME). I obtained my PhD (cum laude) and master's (cum laude) in Educational Psychology from Erasmus University Rotterdam. My PhD dissertation on Enhancing Self-Regulated Learning Through Instructional Supports and Learning Analytics in Online Higher Education was awarded the Best Thesis Award 2021 by the Erasmus Graduate School of Social and Behavioral Sciences. </p>

        <p class="text-xl">My passion for teaching and learning drives my interest in educational research. I have ten years of teaching experience across Singapore, China, and The Netherlands. Upon completing my teaching diploma in 2003 from the National Institute of Education in Singapore, I taught various subjects at public primary and secondary schools in Singapore. Apart from teaching, I was actively involved in piloting and implementing innovative Information Technology (IT) tools for education and was also involved in student welfare and development. In 2010, I took on a teaching position at the Singapore International School in Shanghai, China. In 2013, I became the coordinator of the optimal learning program, where I developed education plans to support different groups of students. Intrigued by students' learning process and how to enhance learning, I pursued my master's and PhD in educational psychology to equip myself with the knowledge to become a more effective teacher. I am particularly interested in designing instructions to support students who are struggling in their learning and to support students in using effective study strategies to optimize their learning. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-xl">In my current capacity as an assistant professor in educational sciences, I teach courses on educational psychology, education and ICT, and research methods and skills to students who are and might be taking on roles in the education sector. I enjoy discussing teaching and learning experiences and having students think of concrete examples in which educational theories can be applied. Furthermore, with the increasing use of technology in education, I would like to employ the use of learning analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance our understanding of the learning process and provide individual students with more targeted support.</p>

                <li>The aim of this thesis is twofold: 1) to investigate how self-regulated learning (SRL) can be facilitated in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), and 2) to explore learning analytics as a tool to investigate SRL. The dissertation provides insight into the design, implementation, challenges, and future directions for SRL support in MOOCs as well as the use of learning analytics to measure and facilitate SRL.</li>
